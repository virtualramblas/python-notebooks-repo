## Pix2Pix for Satellite-to-Map Image Translation in Keras
Notebooks for the data preparation and training of a pix2pix GAN [Keras](https://keras.io/) implementation from [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-pix2pix-gan-for-image-to-image-translation/) following [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) (the official paper implementation is in PyTorch). The purpose of this Keras model is satellite images translation into Google Maps images.  
This repo includes 2 notebooks:  
* [Data Preparation](https://github.com/virtualramblas/python-notebooks-repo/blob/main/Colab/Pix2Pix/Pix2Pix_for_Satellite_to_Map_Image_Translation_Data_Preparation.ipynb)  
* Training (to be added)
