## StyleCariGAN Evaluation
A notebook to evaluate the *StyleCariGAN: Caricature Generation via StyleGAN Feature Map Modulation* [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04331) on your own images.  
StyleCariGAN is a caricature generation framework based on shape and style manipulation using StyleGAN. It automatically creates a realistic and detailed caricature from an input photo with optional controls on shape exaggeration degree and color stylization type.  
A GPU runtime is needed to run this code successfully.
