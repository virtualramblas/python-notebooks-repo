## TBEFN: A Two-branch Exposure-fusion Network for Low-light Image Enhancement
Unofficial TensorFlow 2.x implementation of this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9261119). The official code is compatible with TensorFlow 1.x only.  
**Update October 10th 2021: the TF 2 code has been now merged to the official GitHub repo for this paper.**  
This is the proposed architecture:

No GPU runtime needed to execute the code in this notebook.  
Some examples (on the left the original low-light images, on the right the TBEFN outputs):
