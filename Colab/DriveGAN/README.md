## Playing with the DriveGAN simulator in Colab
A notebook for a rapid set up and to play with the [DriveGAN](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/DriveGAN/) simulator in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  
DriveGAN is a fully differentiable simulator that allows for re-simulation of a given video sequence, offering an agent to drive through a recorded scene again, possibly taking different actions.  
Upload the *DriveGAN_Playground.ipynb* notebook to Colab and execute it. A GPU runtime is required: you can switch to this kind of runtime from the *Runtime -> Change runtime type* Colab menu.
