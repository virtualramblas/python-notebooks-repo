# ViT (Vision Transformer) PyTorch
A notebook to train a Visual Transformer for binary image classification in Google Colab (Python 3 and PyTorch). Started from a Python package and a notebook in a lucidrains [repo](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch).  
Please refer to [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy) and [this other one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768) for implementation details.  
A GPU runtime is needed to train the model in this notebook.
