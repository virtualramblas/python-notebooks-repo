# AdelaiDepth ResNet101 Test
A notebook to test monocular depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction from single RGB images using the Open Source [AdelaiDepth](https://github.com/aim-uofa/AdelaiDepth) toolbox.  This notebook is derived from the original one available in the official GitHub repo for the toolbox and other than some code refactoring, it includes also the possibility to perform 3D scene reconstruction (not available in the original).
