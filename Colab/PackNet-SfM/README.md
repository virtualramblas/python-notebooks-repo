## Monocular Depth Estimation using the Toyota's PackNet-SfM.
A notebook for a rapid setup and to do inference with the Toyota's [PackNet-SfM](https://github.com/virtualramblas/packnet-sfm) in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  
PackNet-SfM is the official PyTorch implementation of the Neural Ray Surfaces for Self-Supervised Learning of Depth and Ego-motion [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02693), a generalized self-supervised depth and pose estimation beyond the pinhole model to all central cameras, which allows the learning of meaningful depth and pose on non-pinhole cameras such as fisheye and catadioptric.
