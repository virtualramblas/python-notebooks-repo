# SinGAN
This repository hosts notebooks to train and/or perform other generative tasks with SinGAN, an unconditional generative model that can be learned from a single natural image. You can read about the original SinGAN paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164). The official source code associated to this paper is implemented in Python 3 and the Deep Learning framework of reference is PyTorch. In this repo you can find Colab notebooks releated to the official [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation and a community port to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 2.  
A GPU runtime is needed to execute the code in any of these notebooks.
